# Programmable Interrupt Controller 8259A

## Relevant registers

* Command Register: Write-only register, used to send commands to the PIC. 
* Interrupt Request Register (`IRR`): Specifies pending interrupts
    * Each bit in the `IRR` corresponds to an IRQ number.
    * If a bit is set, the corresponding IRQ is signalled by the device and is
    pending
* In-Service Register (`ISR`): Specifies which interrupts are acknowledged but
  waiting an `EOI` signal
* Interrupt Mask Register (`IMR`): Specifies which interrupts are to be ignored.
    * A set bit in the `IMR` indicates that an interrupt shall be ignored.

## Software Ports

All hardware controllers are mapped to IO ports that can be accessed using the
`IN` and `OUT` instructions. The `PIC` is no special. Each `PIC` is mapped to
two IO Ports.

| Port Address | Description                           |
|:------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|0x20          | Master PIC Command Register           |
|0x21          | Master PIC Data & Mask Registers      |
|0xA0          | Slave PIC Command Registers           |
|0xA1          | Slave PIC Data & Mask Registers       |

Command register is different from the Status register as the command register
is write-only and the status register is read-only. The PIC differentiates
between the two using the read/write enable signals.
